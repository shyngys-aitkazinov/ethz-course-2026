    Steps:
    1. Generate `num_points` linearly spaced time steps `s` between 0 and 1.
    2. Apply the quintic time scaling polynomial function which can be found in the slides to get `f_s`.
    3. Interpolate between `start` and `end` using `start + (end - start) * f_s`.

    Args:
        start (np.ndarray): Starting waypoint.
        end (np.ndarray): Ending waypoint.
        num_points (int): Number of points in the trajectory.

    Compute the PID control signal based on the tracking error history.

    Steps:
    1. The Proportional (P) term is the most recent error.
    2. The Integral (I) term is the sum of all past errors, multiplied by the simulation timestep.
    3. The Derivative (D) term is the rate of change of the error (difference between the last two errors divided by the timestep).
       If there is only one error in history, the D term should be zero.
    4. Compute the final control signal: Kp * P + Ki * I + Kd * D.

    Args:
        tracking_error_history (np.ndarray): History of tracking errors.
